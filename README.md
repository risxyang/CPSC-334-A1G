The first window immediately generated by main.py is meant to stay on the main monitor screen. Begin the mapping process by pressing START.

Drag the new generated window horizontally, and resize it so that it covers the entire space displayed on one projector. Input the Projector Number and Orientation on the main screen, and press Set. This prints these inputted values to stdout, along with the monitor number. Then return to the projected window and hit the large PRESS FOR COORDINATES button. This prints the resolution, and the coordinates for the lop-left corner and bottom-right conrer to stdout.

Now move the second window to the right until it encompasses the next projector space, enter your values, and press both buttons again. Continue this process until the data for each projector has been recorded.

Close both windows when you are finished mapping all 6 projectors. Stdout should now display the Monitor Number, Projector Number, Orientation, Resolution, Top Left Coordinate, and Bottom Right Coordinate of each one.
